Context:  A ​palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelt the same way forward and backward  (disregarding whitespace, punctuation and capitalization). Examples include ​madam,level,nurses run. 

Task:  Create a simple web app that identifies palindromes. At a minimum, it should take in a  word/phrase from the user via a textbox, determine whether or not it is a palindrome, and  display the result. It should also keep a record of the last 5 entries made by the user. 


UI Design:  Include a textbox for collecting the input, a button which the user clicks to process the  word/phrase, a label that displays the result, and a means to display the last 5 entries.
